If you have your own server, and using HEXO for blogging, and looking for an editor that can use online anywhere anytime, and ... Bingo! You found it !

I write this project because almost every markdown editor I tried is not convenient enought when writting blog with HEXO. I always have to add tags categories and front-matters mannuly, and run script to generate and deloy(even though it is convenient enough for most people). So I write this one to edit HEXO post in a convenient way by just click click and click.

The is a part of  [@winin/hexo-editor](https://github.com/YuJianghao/winwin-hexo-editor). See [@winin/hexo-editor-client](https://github.com/YuJianghao/winwin-hexo-editor-client), [@winin/hexo-editor-sdk](https://github.com/YuJianghao/winwin-hexo-editor-sdk) and [Hand by hand installation guide](http://blog.yujianghao.cn/2020/03/16/rv13LtBZuoRgOPWy/) too !

API doc is comming soon... You can find it in `./src/controller.js`.

## Usage

### Core

- Inside your koa app file, mount hexo-editor-server to app.
- Set `opts.hexoRoot` to your hexo blog folder, i.e. the same folder as your hexo `_config.yml` file.

```js
// app.js
// mount hexo-editor-server to koa app
hexoeditorserver(app, {
    base: '/hexo',
    /* auth: */ /* some authentication middleware */ 
    hexoRoot: 'your/blog/path' 
})

```

- See `./example/app.js`, [document](https://yujianghao.github.io/winwin-hexo-editor-server/module-hexo-editor-serever.html) and [@winin/hexo-editor](https://github.com/YuJianghao/winwin-hexo-editor) for more usage and examples.

### Hexo-cli and Git

- If you want to deploy blog, you need to config your `hexo deploy` and `hexo generate` command. see [HEXO's doc](https://hexo.io/docs/one-command-deployment.html)
- If you want to use Git for backup, you need to config Git repository with a remote origin(`git push` and `git pull`).

## Options

- `hexoRoot`: your hexo blog folder, i.e. the same folder as your hexo `_config.yml` file. Required.
- `base`: the root url your hexo-editor-server will be runing at. Defulat to `/hexo/`.
- `auth`: a custom authentication koa middleware. Default to `undefined`.
