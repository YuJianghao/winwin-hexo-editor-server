# @winwin/hexo-editor-server

A koa2 middleware provides hexo eidting API.

If you have your own server, and using HEXO for blogging, and looking for an editor that can use anythere anytime, and ... Bingo! You found it ! I write this project because almost every markdown editor I tried is not convenient enought when I'm writting blog with HEXO. I always has to add tags categories and front-matters mannuly, and run script to generate and deloy my blog(even though it is convenient enough for most people). So I write this one to edit HEXO post in a convenient way by just click click and click.

I also have a SPA hexo-editor-client based on Vue and Quasar.( I promise I'm working on it !‚ù§).

API doc is comming soon... You can find it in `./src/controller.js`.

npm install --save @winin/hexo-editor-server
